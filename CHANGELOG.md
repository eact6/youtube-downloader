# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- Fix command-line arguments construction bug for audio downloads, preventing `yt-dlp` exits with error code 2 when extracting to MP3 by sequentially building arguments instead of using fragile `splice` offsets.
- Fix sequential parameter building for subtitle downloads, replacing fragile `splice` logic to prevent potential argument-parsing errors in the future.
- Fix UI copywriting mismatch in "Download Video" and "Download Audio" cards, making card descriptions update dynamically to match the user's preferred format settings immediately upon load or save.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Add a comprehensive and premium "Settings" tab to allow users to customize their experience (`index.html`, `styles.css`).
- Add visual, native folder selection using Electron's `dialog.showOpenDialog` to let users choose a custom base download folder, with "Reset" and "Browse" actions.
- Add dynamic theme selection with an interactive color picker supporting 6 premium accent palettes (Sleek Silver, YouTube Red, Cyan Spark, Emerald Green, Royal Velvet Purple, and Amber Gold) featuring instant live preview.
- Add real-time success chime synthesized dynamically via Web Audio API oscillators and gains when a download successfully completes.
- Add an "Auto-Open File Location" checkbox to automatically reveal files in Windows Explorer upon successful download completion.
- Add customizable download defaults pre-selected for new videos (Quality/Resolution) and subtitles (Language).
- Add customizable Preferred Video Format (MP4, MKV, WebM) and Audio Format (MP3, M4A, WAV, FLAC) selectors in Settings, including full formatting guidance (e.g. MP4 for Premiere/After Effects, WAV for lossless sound editing).
- Add a premium, Shadcn-style custom progress bar with smooth CSS width transitions that parses the yt-dlp console output in real-time to display active percentage levels during media downloads.
- Add an active download blocking locking system that warns the user with a focused dialog and a warning log if they attempt to launch new downloads before current processes conclude.
- Add responsive drag-to-resize panel support for the Status Terminal via a top resize drag-bar that allows manual height customization with precise limit bounds.
- Add quick-access folder navigation buttons ("Open Videos Folder", "Open Audios Folder") to the Recents activity tab header, instantly revealing target save locations.

### Changed
- Refactor all download channels (Video, Audio, and Subtitles) to retrieve and apply the user's custom save location dynamically, falling back to the default OS Downloads directory.
- Expose secure settings retrieval, directory browse dialog, and settings saving APIs using Electron's two-way IPC `invoke` and `handle` mechanisms (`preload.js`, `main.js`, `renderer.js`).
- Refactor video and audio download routines to dynamically request and map container formats (WebM/MKV/MP4) and audio codecs (MP3/M4A/WAV/FLAC) in yt-dlp arguments, preserving strict H.264 MP4 and high VBR MP3 as editing-compatible defaults.
- Refactor the main dashboard layout to make the status terminal panel more compact (default height of 160px with top-resize handle styling).
- Hide the status terminal and progress bar elements from view entirely when transitioning to the settings tab to preserve a clean and premium setup aesthetic.
- Refactor final file path matches in download streams to support direct WebM, uncompressed WAV, lossless FLAC, and standard M4A files while strictly excluding intermediate stream fragments (.fXXX) and .ytdl files, keeping all history thumbnail click folder reveal and highlight actions fully functional.
- Add filesystem fallback checks to standard file opening methods, automatically opening containing directory folders in Windows Explorer if the downloaded media files themselves are deleted or renamed.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Add Electron wrapper with modern Shadcn-inspired responsive user interface (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `renderer.js`).
- Add robust `yt-dlp` integration supporting high-quality video (Adobe After Effects compatible H.264 MP4), audio-only (MP3 320kbps), and subtitle extraction (`main.js`).
- Add asynchronous background update checkers for `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` availability on launch.
- Add file path tracking to capture final downloaded file paths from `yt-dlp` stdout.
- Add beautiful Recents list with YouTube thumbnails fetched synchronously from video IDs (`renderer.js`).
- Add secure folder opening on Windows Explorer when clicking history cards, calling Electron's `shell.showItemInFolder()` via IPC.
- Add standard NPM packaging scripts and `electron-builder` configuration for distributables.
- Add local project-level auto-updater skill under `.skills/changelog-updater/SKILL.md` to guide AI agents in automatically recording future workspace changes.
