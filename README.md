## Key Features

- 🎥 **High-Quality Video Downloads**: Support for multiple format containers (MP4, MKV, WebM) with H.264/H.265 video paired with AAC/Opus audio (MP4 is default and pre-optimized for Adobe Premiere/After Effects compatibility).
- 🎵 **Variable Bitrate & Lossless Audio Extraction**: Extract audio streams directly to MP3 (up to 320kbps Level 0 VBR), M4A, FLAC (lossless compressed), or WAV (PCM uncompressed, 24-bit 48kHz for high-fidelity studio editing) via `ffmpeg`.
- 💬 **Subtitle Extraction**: Download YouTube closed-captions and standard subtitles in English and other languages instantly without downloading the video itself.
- ⚙️ **Persistent Application Settings**: Dynamically change and persist your base save locations, pre-selected default video qualities, preferred subtitle languages, and preferred output container and codec formats, with dynamic tab card descriptions reflecting your active selections.
- 🎨 **Dynamic Theme Accent Palettes**: Re-theme the entire application instantly with one of six curated color scheme styles (Silver, YouTube Red, Cyan Spark, Emerald, Velvet Purple, and Gold Mine) featuring dynamic CSS variables.
- 🔊 **Dynamic Sound Synthesizer**: Premium double-tone completion chimes synthesized dynamically in real-time using the Web Audio API on successful downloads.
- 📂 **Auto-Reveal Downloads**: Optional setting to automatically open the download folder in Windows Explorer and highlight the file once the download completes.
- 🎨 **Shadcn-Inspired Design**: A sleek, fully responsive true dark-mode dashboard featuring modern glassmorphism elements, Lucide UI icons, and smooth micro-animations.
- ⚡ **Asynchronous Background Checkers**: Instant verification of `yt-dlp` updates and `ffmpeg` availability on application launch, keeping the UI fully interactive.
- 🕒 **Cached Recents History**: Locally cached history (via `localStorage`) showing active YouTube thumbnails fetched dynamically from video IDs.
- 📁 **Direct Folder Navigation**: Instantly reveal downloaded items in Windows Explorer with a single click on history thumbnails.

## Technical Architecture

The application strictly separates backend OS processes from the frontend rendering layer for security, utilizing Electron's safe IPC bridge architecture.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Renderer [Renderer Process (Chromium)]
        UI["HTML/CSS Dashboard"] <--> RenderJS["renderer.js"]
    end

    subgraph Bridge [Bridge (Context Isolation)]
        Preload["preload.js (contextBridge)"]
    end

    subgraph Main [Main Process (Node.js)]
        MainJS["main.js"] <--> YTDLP["yt-dlp child_process"]
        MainJS <--> FFmpeg["ffmpeg child_process"]
        MainJS <--> Shell["shell.showItemInFolder"]
    end

    RenderJS <-->|Secure API Calls| Preload
    Preload <-->|IPC Channels| MainJS
```

- **Main Process (`main.js`)**: Executes in Node.js, holds full OS access, spawns asynchronous child processes for checking and updating `yt-dlp`, executes the download commands, and streams shell outputs back to the GUI.
- **Preload Script (`preload.js`)**: A secure, isolated context bridge exposing only specific, safe IPC methods to the frontend without exposing Node.js primitives.
- **Renderer Process (`renderer.js`)**: The frontend UI that captures user events, displays download progress logs, updates localStorage history, and communicates with the preload bridge.

## System Prerequisites

To run this application, ensure the following command-line tools are accessible on your system's environment PATH:

1. **`yt-dlp`**: The core media extraction tool. It will check and auto-update itself on application launch if it has permission.
2. **`ffmpeg`**: Required for merging video and audio streams, as well as extracting and encoding MP3 audio.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the project dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-downloader.git
cd youtube-downloader
npm install
```

### 2. Development Mode

Launch the Electron window in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Packaging & Building

Compile and bundle the production-ready standalone Windows installer (`.exe`) using **electron-builder**:

```bash
npm run dist
```

This encapsulates all code and maps designated icons (`build/icon.png`) into a single setup executable.
